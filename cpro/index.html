  Doing Assignments:
<ol>
<li>For every problem write the solution in file <span class="code">code.c</span> where the file <span class="code">problem.pdf</span> is located.</li>
<li>Run checking script script like this: <span class="code">./check.sh Assignments/A1/BX</span>. Replace the path of the question accordingly.</li>
<li>If the script gives some permission error, run <span class="code">chmod +x check.sh</span>.</li>
<li>It's ethically wrong to see anything inside <span class="code">IO</span> folder.</li>
<li>Depending on your code, a test case can either pass or give TLE. Since the checker script is not perfect, it'll never give wrong rather will tell your output and expected output. It's then upto you to decide whether the output is same or different.</span>
</ol>
Labs:
<ul>
<li>I directly added the Labs folder without formatting it.</li>
<li>For lab exams, you can use the checker script (just like you did for assignments) by simply moving all the <span class="code">.in</span> and <span class="code">.out</span> files of that problem in a new folder named <span class="code">IO</span></li>
</ul>

<br />
All the best!
<br />
Let me know if you're done with the first Assignment. Will be happy to add the second one!
